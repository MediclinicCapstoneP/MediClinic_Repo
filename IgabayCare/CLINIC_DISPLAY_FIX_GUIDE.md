# Fix Clinic Display Issue - Step by Step Guide

## Problem: 
Your OHARA clinic exists in the database with `status = 'approved'` but is not showing up in the patient home page.

## Root Cause:
This is most likely a Row Level Security (RLS) policy issue that's preventing public access to approved clinics.

## Solution Steps:

### Step 1: Fix RLS Policies
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the script: `database/fix_clinic_rls_policy.sql`

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After running the SQL script, check the browser console for these new debug messages:
- `ðŸ”¬ Testing basic table access...`
- `ðŸ“Š Total clinics in table: X`
- `ðŸŽ¯ Fetching approved clinics...`

### Step 3: Expected Results
You should see:
- `ðŸ“Š Total clinics in table: 1` (or more)
- `âœ… Found 1 approved clinic(s)`
- Your OHARA clinic displaying as a card

## What the SQL Script Does:

1. **Checks existing policies** - Shows what RLS policies currently exist
2. **Removes problematic policies** - Cleans up any conflicting policies
3. **Creates correct policy** - Allows public read access to approved clinics
4. **Grants permissions** - Ensures anon and authenticated users can read clinics
5. **Tests the fix** - Verifies your OHARA clinic can be queried

## Your Clinic Data:
```
Clinic Name: OHARA
Email: rexloverem@gmail.com
Phone: 098765432
City: agfaf
Status: approved âœ“
Specialties: Cardiology, Dermatology, Psychiatry
Services: Vaccination, General Consultation, Physical Therapy, Mental Health Services
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check console errors** - Open browser dev tools (F12) and look for error messages
2. **Verify RLS policies** - Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, roles, cmd, qual 
   FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename = 'clinics';
   ```
3. **Test direct query** - Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   SELECT clinic_name, status FROM clinics WHERE status = 'approved';
   ```

## Next Steps After Fix:
Once your clinic appears, you'll see it as a professional card with:
- âœ“ Verified status badge
- Your clinic name and description
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Address information
- Specialty badges (Cardiology, Dermatology, Psychiatry)
- Staff information (5 doctors, 10 staff)
- "View Details & Book Appointment" button
