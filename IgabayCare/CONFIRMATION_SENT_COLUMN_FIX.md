# Confirmation Sent Column Error Fix

## Problem
The application encounters a `PGRST204` error when trying to update appointments:

```
Error updating appointment: {code: 'PGRST204', details: null, hint: null, message: "Could not find the 'confirmation_sent' column of 'appointments' in the schema cache"}
```

This error occurs when the `AppointmentService.confirmAppointment()` method tries to update the `confirmation_sent` and `confirmation_sent_at` fields in the appointments table, but these columns don't exist in the database schema.

## Root Cause
The TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/appointments.ts` define notification and confirmation fields, but the actual database table is missing these columns. This creates a mismatch between the application code and the database schema.

**Missing Fields:**
- `confirmation_sent` (BOOLEAN)
- `confirmation_sent_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `reminder_sent` (BOOLEAN)
- `reminder_sent_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `cancelled_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `cancelled_by` (UUID)
- `cancellation_reason` (TEXT)

## Solution

### 1. Database Schema Fix (Recommended)
Run the SQL script to add the missing columns to your database:

```sql
-- Quick fix: Add missing notification columns
ALTER TABLE public.appointments 
ADD COLUMN confirmation_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN confirmation_sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN reminder_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN reminder_sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN cancelled_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN cancelled_by UUID,
ADD COLUMN cancellation_reason TEXT;
```

**Execute this script in your Supabase SQL Editor:**
- Use `database/quick_fix_confirmation_sent.sql` for the complete fix
- Or use `database/fix_appointments_schema_comprehensive.sql` for a comprehensive schema update

### 2. Application-Level Fallback (Already Implemented)
The `AppointmentService.updateAppointment()` method now includes enhanced fallback logic that:

1. **Attempts the full update first** - tries to update with all fields including notification columns
2. **Detects schema errors** - catches `PGRST204` errors indicating missing columns
3. **Falls back to safe mode** - removes potentially missing fields and retries the update
4. **Logs warnings** - informs developers about schema mismatches

**Enhanced fallback fields list:**
- `doctor_specialty`
- `priority`
- `duration_minutes`
- `patient_notes`
- `confirmation_sent`
- `confirmation_sent_at`
- `reminder_sent`
- `reminder_sent_at`
- `cancelled_at`
- `cancelled_by`
- `cancellation_reason`

## Files Modified

### Database Scripts
- `database/fix_appointments_schema_comprehensive.sql` - Updated to include all notification columns
- `database/quick_fix_confirmation_sent.sql` - New quick fix script specifically for notification columns

### Application Code
- `src/features/auth/utils/appointmentService.ts` - Enhanced `updateAppointment()` method with extended fallback logic

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Complete Database Fix (Recommended)
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the `database/quick_fix_confirmation_sent.sql` script
4. Verify the columns were added successfully

### Option 2: Use Application Fallback
The application will automatically handle missing columns gracefully. However, you should still update the database schema for optimal performance.

## Verification

After applying the database fix, verify it worked:

```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'appointments' 
AND column_name IN (
    'confirmation_sent', 'confirmation_sent_at', 
    'reminder_sent', 'reminder_sent_at',
    'cancelled_at', 'cancelled_by', 'cancellation_reason'
);

-- Check appointment notification status
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_appointments,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN confirmation_sent = true THEN 1 END) as confirmed_appointments,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN reminder_sent = true THEN 1 END) as reminded_appointments
FROM appointments;
```

## Affected Operations

### Before Fix (Will Fail):
- **Confirming appointments** - Uses `confirmation_sent` and `confirmation_sent_at`
- **Sending reminders** - Uses `reminder_sent` and `reminder_sent_at`
- **Canceling appointments** - Uses `cancelled_at`, `cancelled_by`, and `cancellation_reason`

### After Fix (Will Work):
- ✅ **Appointment confirmation** - Sets confirmation status and timestamp
- ✅ **Reminder tracking** - Tracks when reminders are sent
- ✅ **Cancellation tracking** - Records cancellation details and reasons

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Schema Validation** - Run comprehensive schema checks before deploying
2. **Migration Scripts** - Use proper database migration scripts for schema changes
3. **Type Safety** - Ensure TypeScript interfaces match actual database schema
4. **Testing** - Test database operations in staging before production
5. **Monitoring** - Monitor for `PGRST204` errors in production logs

## Code Examples

### Confirming an Appointment:
```typescript
// This will now work with both old and new database schemas
await AppointmentService.confirmAppointment(appointmentId);

// Behind the scenes, it tries:
await AppointmentService.updateAppointment(appointmentId, {
  status: 'confirmed',
  confirmation_sent: true,
  confirmation_sent_at: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

### Canceling an Appointment:
```typescript
// This will now work with both old and new database schemas
await AppointmentService.cancelAppointment(appointmentId, 'Patient no longer needs appointment');

// Behind the scenes, it tries:
await AppointmentService.updateAppointment(appointmentId, {
  status: 'cancelled',
  cancelled_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  cancellation_reason: 'Patient no longer needs appointment'
});
```

## Related Memory
This fix addresses the database schema management requirements mentioned in project memory about ensuring database schema matches code implementation and preventing schema mismatch errors. It follows the comprehensive database management strategies for schema evolution and error handling.

## Technical Details

### Database Column Specifications:
- `confirmation_sent` BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE - Tracks if confirmation was sent
- `confirmation_sent_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE - When confirmation was sent
- `reminder_sent` BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE - Tracks if reminder was sent
- `reminder_sent_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE - When reminder was sent
- `cancelled_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE - When appointment was cancelled
- `cancelled_by` UUID - Who cancelled the appointment (references auth.users)
- `cancellation_reason` TEXT - Reason for cancellation

### Performance Impact:
- Adding columns to existing table is a fast operation
- Default values prevent NULL issues
- No data migration required for existing records
- Indexes not required for these columns initially
