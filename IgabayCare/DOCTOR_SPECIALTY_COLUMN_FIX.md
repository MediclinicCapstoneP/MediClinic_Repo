# Doctor Specialty Column Error Fix

## Problem
The application encounters a `PGRST204` error when trying to update appointments:

```
Error updating appointment: {code: 'PGRST204', details: null, hint: null, message: "Could not find the 'doctor_specialty' column of 'appointments' in the schema cache"}
```

This error occurs when the `AppointmentService.updateAppointment()` method tries to update the `doctor_specialty` field in the appointments table, but this column doesn't exist in the database schema.

## Root Cause
The TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/appointments.ts` define a `doctor_specialty` field, but the actual database table is missing this column. This creates a mismatch between the application code and the database schema.

## Solution

### 1. Database Schema Fix (Recommended)
Run the SQL script to add the missing column to your database:

```sql
-- Quick fix: Add missing doctor_specialty column
ALTER TABLE public.appointments 
ADD COLUMN doctor_specialty VARCHAR(255);

-- Populate existing records from doctors table
UPDATE public.appointments 
SET doctor_specialty = d.specialization
FROM public.doctors d
WHERE appointments.doctor_id IS NOT NULL 
AND appointments.doctor_specialty IS NULL
AND appointments.doctor_id = d.id;
```

**Execute this script in your Supabase SQL Editor:**
- Use `database/quick_fix_doctor_specialty.sql` for the complete fix
- Or use `database/fix_appointments_schema_comprehensive.sql` for a comprehensive schema update

### 2. Application-Level Fallback (Already Implemented)
The `AppointmentService.updateAppointment()` method now includes fallback logic that:

1. **Attempts the full update first** - tries to update with all fields including `doctor_specialty`
2. **Detects schema errors** - catches `PGRST204` errors indicating missing columns
3. **Falls back to safe mode** - removes potentially missing fields and retries the update
4. **Logs warnings** - informs developers about schema mismatches

This ensures the application continues to work even if the database schema isn't updated.

## Files Modified

### Database Scripts
- `database/fix_appointments_schema_comprehensive.sql` - Updated to include `doctor_specialty` column
- `database/quick_fix_doctor_specialty.sql` - New quick fix script specifically for this issue

### Application Code
- `src/features/auth/utils/appointmentService.ts` - Enhanced `updateAppointment()` method with fallback logic

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Complete Database Fix (Recommended)
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the `database/quick_fix_doctor_specialty.sql` script
4. Verify the column was added successfully

### Option 2: Use Application Fallback
The application will automatically handle missing columns gracefully. However, you should still update the database schema for optimal performance.

## Verification

After applying the database fix, verify it worked:

```sql
-- Check if column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'appointments' 
AND column_name = 'doctor_specialty';

-- Check populated data
SELECT doctor_name, doctor_specialty 
FROM appointments 
WHERE doctor_specialty IS NOT NULL 
LIMIT 5;
```

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Schema Validation** - Run comprehensive schema checks before deploying
2. **Migration Scripts** - Use proper database migration scripts for schema changes
3. **Type Safety** - Ensure TypeScript interfaces match actual database schema
4. **Testing** - Test database operations in staging before production
