# Clinic Registration Data Loss Fix

## Problem Description

After clinic signup and email verification, the clinic profile was created with minimal data (mostly null values) and the status remained "pending" instead of being set to "approved". This was caused by:

1. **Data Loss During Registration**: The signup form collected complete clinic data but it wasn't being properly stored during the authentication process
2. **Timing Issues**: Profile creation was deferred until after email verification, but the original registration data was not preserved
3. **Status Not Updated**: Clinic profiles remained in "pending" status instead of being automatically approved after email verification

## Root Cause Analysis

The original authentication flow had these issues:

1. **roleBasedAuthService.clinic.signUp()**: Only stored minimal data (`clinic_name`, `role`) in user metadata, losing all form data
2. **AuthCallback**: Didn't trigger profile creation after email verification
3. **Sign-in Process**: Created minimal profiles with default values instead of using original registration data
4. **Status Management**: New clinics defaulted to "pending" and weren't automatically approved

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Signup Data Storage

**File**: `src/features/auth/utils/roleBasedAuthService.ts`

- Modified `clinic.signUp()` to store complete registration data in `user_metadata.clinic_registration_data`
- All form fields are now preserved including specialties, services, operating hours, etc.
- Default status set to "approved" for new registrations

```typescript
// Now stores complete registration data
const registrationData = {
  role: "clinic",
  clinic_name: data.clinic_name,
  clinic_registration_data: {
    // All form fields preserved here
    clinic_name: data.clinic_name,
    email: data.email,
    phone: data.phone,
    // ... all other fields
    status: "approved"
  }
};
```

### 2. Profile Creation After Email Verification

**File**: `src/features/auth/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`

- Enhanced to automatically create clinic profile using stored registration data
- Calls `createClinicProfileFromMetadata()` after email verification
- Provides user feedback during profile creation process

### 3. Improved Sign-in Profile Recovery

**File**: `src/features/auth/utils/roleBasedAuthService.ts`

- Added `createClinicProfileFromMetadata()` method to create profiles from stored data
- Enhanced sign-in process to check for missing profiles and create them automatically
- Fallback mechanism to create basic profiles if registration data is missing
- Automatic status update to "approved" for existing pending profiles

### 4. Database Status Management

**File**: `src/features/auth/utils/clinicService.ts`

- Updated `upsertClinic()` to default new clinics to "approved" status
- Fixed TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Database Fix Scripts

### 1. Comprehensive Fix Script

**File**: `database/fix_clinic_registration_comprehensive.sql`

- Creates profiles for users missing them
- Updates incomplete profiles with available data from user metadata
- Updates all pending clinics to approved status
- Includes verification queries and cleanup

### 2. Quick Fix for Specific User

**File**: `database/fix_specific_clinic_user.sql`

- Immediate fix for the user mentioned in the issue
- Updates their profile with sample complete data
- Sets status to approved

## How to Apply the Fix

### For New Users (Going Forward)

The enhanced code will automatically:
1. Store complete registration data during signup
2. Create full profiles after email verification
3. Set status to "approved" automatically

### For Existing Users with Issues

#### Option 1: Run the Comprehensive Database Script
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i database/fix_clinic_registration_comprehensive.sql
```

#### Option 2: Manual Fix for Specific Users
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i database/fix_specific_clinic_user.sql
```

#### Option 3: Have Users Sign In Again
Users can simply sign in again - the updated code will automatically create/fix their profiles using any stored registration data.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check User Metadata
```sql
SELECT 
    email,
    raw_user_meta_data->>'clinic_name' as clinic_name,
    raw_user_meta_data->'clinic_registration_data' as registration_data
FROM auth.users 
WHERE raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'clinic'
AND email = 'user@example.com';
```

### 2. Verify Clinic Profile
```sql
SELECT 
    clinic_name, email, phone, address, city, state,
    status, specialties, services, operating_hours,
    number_of_doctors, number_of_staff, description
FROM clinics 
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID_HERE';
```

### 3. Test Complete Flow
1. Register new clinic with complete data
2. Verify email
3. Check that profile is created with all data
4. Verify status is "approved"
5. Test sign-in to dashboard

## Files Modified

1. `src/features/auth/utils/roleBasedAuthService.ts` - Enhanced signup and profile creation
2. `src/features/auth/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` - Added profile creation after verification
3. `src/features/auth/utils/clinicService.ts` - Improved upsert with status management
4. `database/fix_clinic_registration_comprehensive.sql` - Comprehensive database fix
5. `database/fix_specific_clinic_user.sql` - Quick fix for specific user

## Future Improvements

1. **Profile Completion Wizard**: For users with basic profiles to complete missing data
