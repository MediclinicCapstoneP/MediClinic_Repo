## Files Updated

### ProfilePicture Component
- Removed debug button and testStorageAccess import
- Cleaned up the component by removing debugging functionality

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Codebase Size**: Removed 10 unused files
2. **Eliminated Confusion**: Removed duplicate components that could cause confusion
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Less code to maintain and fewer potential conflicts
4. **Cleaner Structure**: Removed unused layout components that weren't being used
5. **Removed Debug Code**: Cleaned up debugging utilities that weren't needed in production

## Files That Were Kept

All remaining files are actively used in the application:
- All UI components are imported and used
- All service files are imported and used
- All pages are routed and used
- All auth components are used in their respective pages
- All type definitions are imported and used
- All context providers are used

## Verification

The cleanup was thorough and safe:
- All removed files were verified to not be imported anywhere
- Duplicate components were identified and removed
- Debug utilities were removed
- No breaking changes were introduced
- All remaining files are actively used in the application

The project is now cleaner and more maintainable with 10 fewer files to manage.
