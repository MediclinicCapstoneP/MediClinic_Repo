## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

4. **Test payment flow** with PayMongo test keys
5. **Create follow-up** recommendations
6. **Trigger reminder service** manually

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check appointments
SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE patient_id = 'your-patient-id';

-- Check transactions
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE patient_id = 'your-patient-id';

-- Check notifications
SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE user_id = 'your-patient-id';

-- Check follow-ups
SELECT * FROM follow_up_appointments WHERE patient_id = 'your-patient-id';

-- Check reminders
SELECT * FROM appointment_reminders WHERE patient_id = 'your-patient-id';
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sending**: Check email provider configuration in `.env`
2. **Reminders not working**: Ensure cron service is started and configured
3. **Payment failures**: Verify PayMongo keys and webhook setup
4. **Database errors**: Check RLS policies and user permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:

```typescript
// In your app initialization
console.log('🔧 Debug mode enabled');
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

- Appointment booking success rate
- Payment completion rate
- Email delivery rate
- Reminder effectiveness
- Follow-up scheduling rate

### Database Queries for Analytics

```sql
-- Appointment booking trends
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as bookings
FROM appointments 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date;

-- Payment success rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as successful,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM transactions;

-- Follow-up conversion rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as recommended,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'scheduled' THEN 1 END) as scheduled,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'scheduled' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as conversion_rate
FROM follow_up_appointments;
```
