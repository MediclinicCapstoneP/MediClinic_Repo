# IgabayCare Flutter Mobile - File Reference Validation

## Issue Resolution Summary

The original error was:
```
Target of URI doesn't exist: '../../features/patient/screens/patient_profile_screen.dart'.
Try creating the file referenced by the URI, or try using a URI for a file that does exist.
```

## Files Created to Resolve Missing References

### âœ… Patient Screens
- **patient_home_screen.dart** - Already existed
- **book_appointment_screen.dart** âœ“ CREATED - Comprehensive appointment booking interface
- **patient_appointments_screen.dart** âœ“ CREATED - Appointment management with tabs
- **patient_profile_screen.dart** âœ“ CREATED - Complete patient profile management

### âœ… Clinic Screens

import '../../features/patient/screens/book_appointment_screen.dart';
import '../../features/patient/screens/patient_appointments_screen.dart';
import '../../features/patient/screens/patient_profile_screen.dart';
import '../../features/clinic/screens/clinic_home_screen.dart';
import '../../features/clinic/screens/clinic_appointments_screen.dart';
import '../../features/clinic/screens/clinic_profile_screen.dart';

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **All Screen Files**: Every screen referenced in the router now exists
2. **Navigation**: Bottom navigation bars for both patient and clinic flows
3. **Widget Organization**: Reusable components properly organized
4. **Import Resolution**: All file references are correctly linked

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Package Dependencies

The current compilation errors are related to Flutter package imports:
- `package:flutter/material.dart`
- `package:go_router/go_router.dart`
- `package:provider/provider.dart`
- `package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart`

These will resolve once Flutter dependencies are installed via `flutter pub get`.

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `flutter pub get` to install all packages
2. **Configure Supabase**: Add your Supabase URL and API keys
3. **Test Compilation**: Run `flutter analyze` to check for any remaining issues
4. **Run Application**: Execute `flutter run` to test the complete app

## Conclusion

âœ… **RESOLVED**: All missing file references have been created
âœ… **COMPLETE**: Router configuration now references existing files
âœ… **READY**: Project structure is complete for development

The original URI target error has been completely resolved. The Flutter mobile app is now ready for development and testing.
